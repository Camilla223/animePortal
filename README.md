# Anime Wiki using Jikan API

This project serves as an introductory exploration into the use of the [Jikan API](https://jikan.moe/), a public REST API for anime data, in combination with **Express.js**, **Axios**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.

I created a basic anime wiki where it's possible to:
- Browse top-rated anime
- Discover anime by genre
- Search for specific titles

This project demonstrates how to integrate a third-party API into a simple web application using modern JavaScript tools and web development practices.
